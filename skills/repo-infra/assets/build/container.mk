# repo-infra: container v1
#
# Autotools as a container driver (D18).
#
# Outside the container this file is the whole build: `make` builds the image,
# and every other target runs in it. Inside the container -- where configure ran
# with --disable-container -- the CONTAINER_DRIVER conditional is false and this
# file defines nothing at all, so the project's own targets stand.
#
# repo-infra owns this file. The project owns its Containerfile and what goes in
# it. Include it from Makefile.am, after calling REPO_INFRA_CONTAINER in
# configure.ac:
#
#     include $(top_srcdir)/build/container.mk
#
# The project may set, before the include:
#
#   CONTAINER_TAG     tag to build and run              (default: $(PACKAGE)-build:local)
#   TEST_DEV_MOUNTS   dirs holding interpreted source   (default: none)
#
# There is deliberately no way to declare host packages. Needing one is what
# sent this project to containers in the first place (D16).
#
# In driver mode, every `make` invocation prints two GNU Make warnings:
#
#     Makefile:NNN: warning: overriding recipe for target 'dist'
#     Makefile:NNN: warning: ignoring old recipe for target 'dist'
#
# Only `dist` warns, not `install`: automake's generated `install:` is
# prerequisite-only and carries no recipe body of its own, so there is no old
# recipe for this fragment's `install:` to override, while automake's `dist:`
# does have one. These lines come from GNU Make itself parsing the generated
# Makefile -- not from automake, so `AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = -Wno-override` does not
# silence them and must not be added. They are the expected sound of this
# fragment replacing automake's own `dist` recipe; they are not a sign
# anything is broken.

# native `make check` already does to the same tree. A :ro mount was tried and
# fails outright: "Read-only file system" from test-driver itself.
